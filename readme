## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Flatdango application locally, you need to have the following installed:

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd flatdango
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Upon opening the application, you will see the details of the first movie, including its poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets. The movie menu on the left side of the page lists all available movies.

To view the details of a specific movie, click on the movie title in the movie menu. The details section will update to show the selected movie's information.

To purchase a ticket, click the "Buy Ticket" button. The number of available tickets will decrease, and if the movie becomes sold out, the button will be disabled.
